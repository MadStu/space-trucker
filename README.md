# Space Trucker Trading Tracker

## Introduction

The Space Trucker Trading Tracker (STTT) is a cargo inventory management tool made for the citizens of [Star Citizen](https://tinyurl.com/2yet2hz9).

Star Citizen (SC) is a deep space, science fiction game / simulation set 930 years in the future. The STTT's main purpose allows SC Traders to keep track of their ship's current cargo inventory and estimated value.

The way trading works in SC is you go to one of many locations and you purchase a particular commodity with "alpha United Earth Credits" (aUEC) which is the in-game currency. You then transport that commodity to another location that's in need of it, and sell them for a profit.

The STTT is at heart a stock and inventory management tracking system that keeps you up to date with your current inventory, your current financial risk and how much you've made or are due to make on your current trading run. 

The commodity pricing in SC is also determined by demand and supply so the pricing is always changing. An organisation called UEX Corp have agents that regularly check the prices at different locations and provide an API that lists the average commodity prices. The STTT uses this data to provide users with their estimated profit. 

I've taken a mobile first design approach with accessibility and ease of use at the top of STTT's priorities. This makes it simple and easy for all space truckers across the galaxy to input the prices and trades from their small screened device without having to switch views on their main monitor and be at risk of piracy.
